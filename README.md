# Blendmask-for-Evaluating-Sludge-Performance
Small Object Feature-Enhanced Visual Segmentation Model Based on Blendmask for Evaluating Sludge Performance

Our project uses a modified BlendMask model to extract granular sludge region features through instance segmentation, and uses association rules to match the features with the granular sludge activity labels to realize the activity evaluation function.
